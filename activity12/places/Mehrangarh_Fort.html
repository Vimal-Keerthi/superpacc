                    <h2 class="display-4 mb-4" style="font-family: Georgia;">Mehrangarh Fort: History</h2>

                    <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Mehrangarh Fort owes its origin to Rao Jodha, the ruler of Mandore and the founder of the city of Jodhpur. When Rao Jodha decided to shift his capital to a safer and elevated location in Jodhpur, he laid the foundation of this massive
                        fort in 1459 on a hill named Bhakurcheeria aka the Mountain of Birds. The cornerstone of the fort was laid by Shri Karni Mata, a female warrior sage. Legend has it that Rao Jodha had to relocate the sole occupant of the hill, a
                        hermit named Cheeria Nathji, in order to build the fort. The enraged hermit cursed that the fort would suffer scarcity of water forever. To appease him, the king built a temple and a house for him within the fort premises. Some
                        local stories even say that Rao Jodha buried alive a common man named Raja Ram Meghwal in the foundations of the fort to nullify the impact of the curse. Since the man had agreed to sacrifice his life willingly, the king promised
                        to look after his family and continued to fulfil his promise diligently. Over the years, Rao Jodha’s successors contributed much to the fort’s structure. They strengthened the fort’s walls and gates and also constructed new palaces
                        and temples within the premises. It was in the 17th century, during the reign of Jaswant Singh of Marwar, that the fort was built into what we see today.

                    <p style="font-family:Times New Roman"> Nestled atop a hill, at a height of 410 feet above the city of Jodhpur, Mehrangarh Fort stands as a majestic citadel of colossal proportions. Also known as Mehran Fort, it boasts of a history of more than 550 years and is surrounded
                        by imposing walls. It is one of the largest forts in the country and is among the most formidable ones in Rajasthan. While the fort itself is an ode to Rajputana grandeur and architectural brilliance, the view it offers of the
                        Jodhpur city spreading out below is no less impressive either. </p>

                        performances take place almost every day within the fort. Another key attraction at the fort is Chokelao Bagh, a beautifully restored 18th-century garden which is also the location of the open-air Chokelao Mahal Restaurant. You
                        can relish a memorable candlelight dinner at the restaurant while enjoying the stunning views of the illuminated fort on one side and the city below on the other. If you are an adventure seeker, you can also try zip-lining at the
                        fort. Every year, the Rajasthan International Folk Festival is celebrated at the fort for five days in the month of October. The fort is also one of the venues for the World Sufi Spirit Festival held in February. Traditional festivals
                        like Gangaur and Dussehra are also celebrated with much pomp and splendour at the fort. Currently, Maharaja Gaj Singh II, the present Rathode clan head, is the custodian of Mehrangarh. The Rao Jodha Desert Rock Park, which is located
                        adjacent to the fort, is another key attraction for travellers visiting Mehrangarh.
