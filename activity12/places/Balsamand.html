                        History of Lake
                    </h2>

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Hop, skip and jump away from Jodhpur, Balsamand Lake is an artificial lake that was built way back in 1159 AD by Balak Rao Parihar as a water reservoir to cater to Mandore. One kilometer long, 50 m broad and 15 m deep; the lake is located amidst a manicured
                        garden full of mango, papaya, pomegranate, guava and plum trees. Jackal and peacock are the prominent guests in the garden. Few years later, an impressive red sandstone summer palace was built on the shores of the lake, which is
                        now converted into a five-star property. Make a point to watch out for pesky monkeys when walking the nature trails.
