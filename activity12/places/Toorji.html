                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Toorji Ka Jhalra was built during the reign of Maharaja Abhai Singh Rathore. He ruled Jodhpur between 1724 and 1749. During that time, the female members of the Royal families, especially the Queens, would participate and head projects to build public
                        water works. Maharaja Abhai Singh Rathore’s wife, the Queen of Marwar (Jodhpur) headed this project and thus Toorji Ka Jhalra was built in the 1740s. She was better known by the name Toorji Ji among the people of Jodhpur. Fetching
                        water from such water bodies had always been among the most important daily tasks of women in those times. A sense of community prevailed in them while they all gathered at such places to discuss daily kinds of stuff. This place
                        was used by the locals for centuries till the city underwent modernization and the well was completely abandoned. In order to restore this historical heritage, the debris inside the well were cleared and the waterbody was cleaned
                        up. The place has, ever since, been recognized as a tourist attraction.

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        The artistry of the stepwell has been done in an exquisite manner depicting the perfection in engineering. Cow and Lion shaped waterspouts were carved for giving the water outlet. The stairs taking you to the water level are beautifully designed with
                        some statues of Gods and Goddesses in between. Viewing galleries also known as Jharokas are constructed around the steps that were used to keep lamps to illuminate the place at night. These are now used as a platform to make a
                        dive deep into the water by the locals. Recently, precious sculptures of elephants in dancing positions were extracted during the cleaning and renovation of the Jhalra, which had been underwater for more than 200 years. These stunning
                        masterpieces are elegantly carved out of the famous Red Ghatu or the Lal Ghatu stone. The technology of Persian Wheels was used to raise the water to higher levels. A pair of oxen used to rotate those wheels from the above platform
                        and water then rose to two different levels.

                        How To Reach Toorji Ka Jhalra

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Toorji ka Jhalra is located in Gulab Sagar Makrana Mohalla on Sutharo ka Bas Road in Jodhpur. From the city centre, the attraction is located about 4.5 kilometres away and can be accessed via the NH 62 – Ratanada Road route. There is another route, which
                        is a longer road, to the stepwell that goes through NH 62 – Harish Joshi Marg (6.2 kilometre stretch from the city centre). The Jodhpur Bus Station and the Jodhpur Airport are located about 6 kilometres away from Toorji Ka Jhalra.
                        The Railway Junction is just about 2.5 kilometres away from it. Public transport works just fine for tourists to reach the attraction. Many reach the central area of Sardar Market or Ghanta Ghar and explore the region till the
                        stepwell on foot. But taxis or auto rickshaws can be easily hired in Jodhpur or one can also take a local bus ride.

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Walk down the stairs very cautiously to avoid any slipping and the chances of accidents, as the steps are very steep there. You should carry some good camera to capture the scintillating shots of peeps splashing into the water with full joy. Avoid going
                        there during the day times in summers as the scorching heat will not let you enjoy the awesome vibes and your itinerary may become an exhausting one.

                        250-year-old architecture of Toorji ka Jhalra was made using the well-known rose-red sandstone found in Jodhpur. In excess of 200 feet top to bottom, it was once decorated with mind boggling carvings of moving elephants, medieval lions, cow waterspouts,
                        and specialties that indicated different divinities.There were two dimensions of access and a different tank which were intended to get water from the wheel system controlled by the bullocks. Its noteworthy plan draws in numerous
                        travellers, and is viewed as a fun place by local people and guests to take part in innocuous, recreational water amusements so as to beat the warmth.
