                        The first thing any visitor would be compelled to do is observe how the lakeside location of Jaswant Thada makes it such a serene place. Taking a walk along the vast enclosure will help a tourist admire the intricate carvings and at the same time look
                        into the history of the rulers of Mewar whose memorials are situated in the monument premises. There are expansive lawns across the grounds of Jaswant Thada where visitors can lounge and bask in the pleasant atmosphere. Along with
                        the memorials, there is also a separate cremation ground of the royal families, where the remains of burnt wood can be seen upon visiting. The squirrels and birds scattered around the grounds of the memorial create a rather calming
                        surrounding, and should certainly be captured in pictures. While visiting the famous Mehrangarh Fort of Jodhpur, Jaswant Thada deserves a visit as it is quite relaxing and is hardly very crowded.

                        Jaswant Thada: Interesting Facts

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Jaswant Thada is named after Maharaja Jaswant Singh II, and it was built by his son Maharaja Sadar Singh in the year 1899. Made of pure white marble that still retains all of its allure, Jaswant Thada also consists of some paintings of the previous rulers
                        of Mewar. Not only are the cenotaphs built of white marble, they are contrasted in red with the steps leading up to the monument, giving it a much vibrant appeal. The shallow lake lining Jaswant Thada was used for performing rituals
                        for the deceased, and it now has a few ducks swimming about. Local musicians and folk singers sit on the steps of the monument to greet the visitors with some authentic Rajasthani melodies. The memorials built inside the monument
                        are beautifully decorated with some elaborate artwork and give a history of whom they are dedicated to. Arches and pillars around the main marble monument at Jaswant Thada are adorned with some delicate carvings, the inside walls
                        of which bear paintings and pictures of the deceased rulers. While the entire building is made in traditional Rajasthani style, the domes are inspired from some of the most creative Mughal architecture, a testament of how the Rajput
                        rulers blended Mughal patterns in their constructions. Along with the shelters bordering the main monument amidst lush greenery and the contrasting colours under the sunlight, Jaswant Thada is quite a mesmerizing sight.
