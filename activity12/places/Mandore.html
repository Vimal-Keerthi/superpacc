                        Famous royal cenotaphs, Mandore Garden is located just 9 kilometres away from Jodhpur in Mandore which was once the ruling seat of the Pratihara dynasty. The garden is a part of the more massive Mehrangarh Fort, and also houses the famous Hall of Heroes
                        and the temple of Three Hundred Million Gods. The garden also has a Government Museum, which is full of artefacts and old relics. The most striking feature of the garden is the gorgeous cenotaphs or dewals that can be found spread
                        all across the Mandore Gardens. Undoubtedly, the most beautiful and famous of these cenotaphs is the one that belongs to Maharaja Ajit Singh. The structures inside the garden are undoubtedly its most striking feature, the Hall
                        of Heroes for instance - has 16 figures of warriors carved from a single rock.

                        The Mandore Gardens are adorned with beautiful cenotaphs, which heighten the beauty of the gardens and add to its rich historical connections. These cenotaphs are a class apart from the usual Rajasthani umbrella-shaped structures, in the sense that these
                        cenotaphs have been erected in a style that was influenced by the architecture of a Hindu temple. These cenotaphs are four-floors high, have all been built in red sandstone, and are complete with well-defined columns and stylish
                        spires.
