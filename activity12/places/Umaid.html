                        Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur Rajasthan is a brilliant example of remarkable constructions. Moreover, now it’s a five star luxurious hotel where one can have a royal stay with all modern comforts. Acquiring an area up to 26 acres of land, the royal mansion
                        is 110 ft high and showcases sumptuous rooms reflecting a rich bygone era. It is one among the most expensive hotels in Jodhpur. The regal palace constitutes of elegant royal heirlooms, high ceilings, marble corridors, treasure
                        troves, hunting trophies, green velvet lawns and courtyards. The interiors of the palace were firstly designed by Maples of London in Art Deco style, but later, the ship carrying the stuff to Bombay was sunk by Germans in 1942.
                        Afterwards, Maharaja Umed Singh himself bought a polished artist namely Stefan Norblin who was an interior decorator and was familiar with the style of Art deco. The beautifully designed paintings and furnishings done by Stefan
                        are still well-preserved here. It is the India’s last royal constructions. Moreover, out of total 26 acres of land, fifteen acres comprises of sprawling gardens, its central cupola, a ball room, a library, indoor swimming, billiards

                        Durbar hall for public gathering, Edwardian drawing room, banquet, cinema hall, a private segment for ladies and billiards room. During its constructions, Umaid Bhawan was the most awaited palace for the’ Maharaos of Kotah’; as
                        before they used to live in a small fort inside the same city. Thus, Umed Sigh decided to build this noble one to comfort the Maharao’s. Later, in 1930, the palace was extended by the architect George Devon, in order to provide
                        space for Maharaj Kumar Bhim Singh and his wife. This section is still reserved and is not open for public, though, rest of the palace is considered to be the private residence as a heritage hotel. Similar to that of other royal
                        Rajput mansions, Umaid Bhawan palace also has a Mardana section for male and a Zenana section for females with separate entrances.

                    <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">
                        Umaid Bhawan Palace was originally designed by H V Lanchester, a well-known Edwardian architect. After the palace disheveled on 18th November 1929, again the foundation stone was laid by Maharaja himself on Chittar hill. There were around fifty thousand
                        men and women, who worked for more than fifteen years to construct this majestic palace, under the supervision of architect Goldstraw. The architect use to get thousand rupees per month and the workers were paid only fifty paisa
                        a day. All the colored stones which were used in the construction of the building were brought by a special train. And the skilled workers cut the big pieces of stones into intricate design form. The imposing palace cost Maharaja
                        around rupees 94, 51,565.

                        The other name of the Umaid Bhawan Palace is the Chittar Palace, due to the fact that stones from the nearby Chittar Hill were used for its construction and were responsible for the golden yellow colour of the edifice. Jodhpur Palace was voted as the
                        World’s Best Hotel of 2016 at the Traveller’s Choice Award function which was organized by the travel website, TripAdvisor. The palace was completed in 1943, tragic as may it seem but Maharaja U. Singh only stayed for four years
                        in the palace as he died in 1947.
